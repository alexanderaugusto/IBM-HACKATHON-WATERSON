# DATASETS AND CODES

## Datasets
Here are all the weather and flood data used in the project to power the Machine Learning model created by the IBM Cloud AutoIa. They were captured using the [INMET API](https://portal.inmet.gov.br/manual) and also the [CGE SÃ£o Paulo website](https://www.cgesp.org/v3/)

## Codes
Here is also a Python code that queries [DarkSky API](https://darksky.net/dev) to get current and future weather data to use in the Machine Learning model developed on the IBM Cloud.
